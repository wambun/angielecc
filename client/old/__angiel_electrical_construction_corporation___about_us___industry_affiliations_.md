The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers has set the highest standards for the electrical industry. Non-union employers consistently pay lower wages and less or no additional benefits to their employees. I.B.E.W. locals have health and welfare plans with dependent coverage. These plans are available after you fulfill the minimum eligibility requirements. Most I.B.E.W. locals have one or more separate and distinct pension plans with eligibility running concurrently.
