# SAFETY

Safety is paramount at Angiel Electrical. Our number 1 goal is to send employees, our greatest asset, home in the same condition or better than they left for work that morning. To accomplish that goal, we start with safety and end with safety in every aspect of our operation. Safety at Angiel Electrical starts from the top down. We employ a designated Safety Director that works closely with executives, management and field employees to provide the tools, training and guidance to work safe, efficient, and productive every day. Our employees go thru training and certification processes such as NFPA Arc Flash, OSHA 10 & 30 hour, Forklifts, Scaffolding and Fall Protection. In addition to daily safety briefings and meetings on the jobsite, we send out a weekly safety training handout on selected topics including, back safety, compressed gases, confined space, driving safety, eye safety, fire, first aid, foot & hand safety, hazard communication, head safety, hearing safety, housekeeping, ladder safety, lock out – tag out, scaffolds, lifts, falling objects, tools and trenching.

The result of our continued safety initiatives include savings to customers by greater efficiency through decreased lost time and work days. Angiel Electrical proudly boasts an average experience modification rate (EMR) of .76 since 2013 with a personal best of .63 in 2015. Our low EMR directly correlates to lower worker’s compensation insurance premiums allowing us to provide the most competitive pricing to our customers.
